You and your friends have made the savvy business decision of acquiring the distribution rights for a certain fictional movie starring a certain fictional superstar. Let's make a game to see who wins the most in box office takings.

Here's an example of how the game might go:

Player1 and Player2 are playing. Player1, being from Chennai, wants exclusive rights to Tamil Nadu. Player2 being from Bangalore, wants exclusive rights to Karnataka. They agree to evenly split the earnings from the rest of the country. This is what their agreement looks like:

```
PLAYER1:
INCLUDE: INDIA
EXCLUDE: KARNATAKA-INDIA

PLAYER2:
INCLUDE: INDIA
EXCLUDE: TAMILNADU-INDIA
```

Take that as the input. To run the game, choose a city at random and award 1 crore to it. If the same city is owned by multiple players, split the money equally among them. Keep repeating. The first player to reach 1000 crores wins!

**We have attached a CSV file with all the countries, states and cities in the world. Use the codes from that file to play the game. The codes given here are just an example.**

**Get the game working with simple rules first, and show us your solution.**

Then try more complex rules with more players, like: 

```
PLAYER1:
INCLUDE: INDIA

PLAYER2:
INCLUDE: CHINA
```

or 

```
PLAYER1:
INCLUDE: TAMILNADU-INDIA
EXCLUDE: COIMBATORE-TAMILNADU-INDIA

PLAYER2:
INCLUDE: KERALA-INDIA
INCLUDE: COIMBATORE-TAMILNADU-INDIA

PLAYER3:
INCLUDE: KARNATAKA-INDIA
```

or any other more advanced worldwide combination of rules. 

*If you finish the game in time and want a huge bonus, analyze the given dataset and tell us what an optimal strategy might be to win the game. If players take turns choosing cities / states / countries, what would be a winning strategy?*
