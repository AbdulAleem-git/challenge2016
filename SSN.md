You and your friends have made the savvy business decision of acquiring the distribution rights for a certain fictional movie starring a certain fictional superstar. Let's make a game to see who wins the most in box office collections.

Here's an example of how the game would go:

Harini and Hegde are playing. Harini chooses Tamil Nadu as her territory, and Hegde wants exclusive rights to Karnataka. Shudan, using his family connections, takes the remainder of India as his area.

To run the game, input / read a list of cities and the box office collection amount in each city. You can design the input file / format yourself. At the end of the list, whoever has the most collections wins!

**We have attached a CSV file with all the countries, states and cities in the world. Use the codes from that file to play the game.**

**Get the game working with these rules first, and show us your solution.**

Now that your game works, figure out the best way for players to input their choices. Design an input file / format to play the game with any number of players, all asking for multiple geographies. 

For example,
Harini takes the USA and Germany;
Hedge takes China and Japan;
Shudan takes the rest of the world.

or 

Harini takes Coimbatore;
Hegde takes the rest of Tamil Nadu;
Shudan takes the rest of India.

or

Harini takes Coimbatore;
Hegde takes the rest of Tamil Nadu;
Shudan takes the rest of India;
Vivek takes the USA and China.

**You will notice that no two players can ever have the same city in their territory.** Any input that would make this happen is invalid. Try to design your input format in a way that such mistakes are either obvious or difficult to make. 

**Please talk to us when you have a workable solution again.**

If you're still here, try expanding your format and game to accommodate exclusions. For instance, Harini might take Tamil Nadu *except* Madurai and Coimbatore. Talk to us about the logical implications of doing this.
